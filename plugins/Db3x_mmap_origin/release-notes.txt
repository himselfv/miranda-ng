This a full version of db3x_mmap database plugin. Old databases/profiles will work correctly.

In the mainline Miranda NG db3x_mmap is gutted and redirects to the new dbx_mdbx, but this one is a restored version updated to work on Miranda NG 0.95.9+


INSTALLATION:
* Choose the version according to your Miranda's bitness.
* Copy to your Miranda\Plugins folder.
  REPLACE the db3x_mmap which comes with Miranda.
  DO NOT UPDATE the db3x_mmap in auto-updater after that.

Q: Should I choose Debug or Release?
A: Choose Release.


AUTO-UPDATER
Do not auto-update this plugin, the updater will install the gutted version. You should download the new full version instead.
The new version might be delayed, and updating Miranda64.exe sometimes breaks compatibility with the plugins, so it's recommended not to update anything at all until new db3x_mmap_origin is available.
