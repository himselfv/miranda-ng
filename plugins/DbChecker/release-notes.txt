This is a working version of DbChecker for db3x_mmap_origin, with the following caveats:

* It has been renamed DbCheckerOrig.dll as the original file is auto-removed.

* You need to run it manually either from Profile manager or from the command line ("/svc:DbCheckerOrig")

* You cannot DbCheck active database. You need to have another, empty, working database and tell Miranda to load that. Then in DbChecker, select the database you want to check.


INSTALLATION:
Choose the version according to your Miranda's bitness.
Copy to your Miranda\Plugins folder.

Q: Should I choose Debug or Release?
A: Choose Release.
